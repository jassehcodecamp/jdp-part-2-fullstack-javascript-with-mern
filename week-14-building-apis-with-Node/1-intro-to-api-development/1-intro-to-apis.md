## What is API?

API which stands for Application Programming Interface, is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating applications software.


## HTTP Protocol

Hypertext Transfer Protocol - this is the internet protocol that powers the web. It is how browsers and web servers communicate.

- It involves Requests and Responses
- It also includes what we called **header** and **body** 


## Rest (Restful)

Rest or Restful stands for Representational State Transfer Protocol. It's a style for building APIs. It provides us with a set of guidelines and principles when building APIs to help us deliver a standard and easy to consume API. 

It heavily relies on HTTP methods and status codes.

By standard, Rest APIs uses JSON data format/structure for it's requests and response data. 

Other types of API standards/protocols for building APIs are:

1. Soap - which uses XML for it's data structure. SOAP is more strict than rest, and older than rest.
   
2. Graphql - which was brought to us by Facebook, is another type of technology and standards for building APIs.

## JSON

Json stands for JavaScript Object Notation, and its basically a lightweight data structure for transfering data over APIs. You will usually see or use JSON when you are working with APIS.

## HTTP Methods

They are also referred to HTTP verbs. There are 2 standard methods that are used by browsers, **GET** and **POST**.

1. GET - to retrieve/query data from the server
2. POST - to submit data to the server
3. PUT  - to replace an existing resource/data on the server
4. PATCH - to update the fields of an existing resource/data on the server
5. DELETE - to delete a data/resource from the server
