1. We first had an overview of the web. We learned that the web which is formally known as the **World Wide Web** (www) is a part/component of the internet that comprises of web pages that are accessed via browsers.


2. Then we had an overview of the course, and the things we are going to learned.

3. We learned that every website/web application typically has two main parts. 
   1. The Frontend - the part of our website that is presented to our ursers.
   2. The Backend  - the part of our website that our users don't see.

4. We learned that at the Frontend, and on our browsers, there are 3 main technologies that usually get involved.
   1. HTML - for creating webpages
   2. CSS  - for styling HTML documents
   3. JavaScript - for adding interactivity on our webpages
<!-- 
5. Then we talked about HTML, one of the most important technologies among the 3.
   
6. Then we talked about the languages of the web. We said there are 3 primary languages of the web
   1. HTML - for creating webpages
   2. CSS  - for stylng webpages (HTML documents)
   3. JavaScript - for adding interactivity on our webpages. -->

7. We also talked about the primary tools we need to start creating webpages:
   1. A Computer (Laptop, or Desktop)
   2. A Code Editor - We need a code editor to write our codes. So we installed [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on our laptops. It is the recommended code editor for this course
   3. A Browser - We need a browser to see the output/results of our codes. [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the recommended browser for this course.

8. Talked about HTML, and learned how to create HTML documents.
   - We learned that the name of a HTML file should end with the **.html** extension. Example **hello.html**

9.  We also learned about one of the most important concepts of HTML, **Tags**. 
    - We said that tags are the basic building block of an HTML document.
    - They tell the browser how to format our content. So we should use tags for any content we would like to put on our web page.  

10. We then unlocked 4 common HTML tags
    1. The Heading Level 1 (h1) tag - The h1, is the highest level of all heading elements (h1 to h6). It is normally used for the main heading of our website/web page. Text we put inside h1 are usually bold and larger than every other text on the page by default.
    
    2. The Heading Level 2 (h2) tag - This is the second highest heading you can have on your web page. Mostly used for sub-headings and secondary titles. 

    3. The Paragraph (p) tag - The p tag is for used for long text and paragraph content.
    
    4. The Image (img) tag - The img tag is for adding image content on our web page. The img tag is a self-closing tag, so there is no corresponding closing tag. To add an image on your web page, you need to have two additional attributes on your img tag. 
       1. The **src** (source) attribute: The src attribute specifies the image to be loaded on our web page. The src is a required attribute.
       2. The **alt** (alternative) attribute: The alt attribute provides an alternative/fallback text in situations where the image can't be loaded. The alt is an optional attribute, but its highly recommended to have on your image.
